In an hourly model, we provide a per-hour rate and bill for actual hours worked, based on weekly reports with invoices. The approximate hourly rate range is 50–100 PLN net – the final rate depends on required skills, urgency, and SLA conditions. When preparing an offer, we always analyze your website and recommend the most cost-effective option (subscription with guaranteed hours or hourly billing). We consider the site’s technical state, integrations, migration/backup needs, and expected response time. If an existing site is heavily outdated or built with non-standard solutions, it’s often more cost-effective to build a new site from scratch instead of a costly overhaul. One-time services are also available."

This staged process ensures critical functions are ready earlier, reduces risk, and spreads costs (milestone billing or full project pricing).
